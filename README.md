# Weather-Dashboard
Challenge 6
## Description
The goal of this challenge was to create a weather dashboard that contained today's current weather and a future 5 day forecast. To do this, we made two fetch calls to the open weather API to retrieve data and build our code from. We mainly used javascript, bootstrap and jquery to complete this task.
